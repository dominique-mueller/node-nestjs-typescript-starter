# node-nestjs-typescript-starter

**Starter for [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) projects using TypeScript**

</div>

<br><br>

## What it does

This is a starter project for NodeJS backend applications, based on the **[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)** framework, written in
**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**. The setup comes with tasks for building and testing the application, further
aspects like linting and / or formatting are not defined but can easily be added on top.

**Here is where things get interesting:** This starter project uses **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** as its build tool. This enables us to deliver the production build of the application as a single minified JavaScrip bundle. *No copying of `node_modules` is necessary!*

> Also see the official **[Nest Framework TypeScript Starter](https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter)**.
